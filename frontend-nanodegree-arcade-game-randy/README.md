Front End Nanodegree Arcade Game
===============================

#  Description
This arcade game is a project for the Front End Web Development Nanodegree course.

# How to Play
Clone or copy the game to your computer.  Open the game in a browser by clicking on the index.html file.  The player begins centered at the bottom of the grass.  You must navigate him across the stones to the water at the top of the canvas using the arrow keys, without colliding with any bugs.  If you collide with a bug, you will see the message "OOPS!  Yer done."  Hit "RETURN" or click "OK" to reset the player and restart the game.  If you reach the water, you will receive the message "YAAAY!  Ya Win!".  Again, Hit "RETURN" or click "OK" to reset the player and start the game again. 

# Variation
You can substitute another player icon by editing the app.js file.  See the images index for other icons.

# TODO
Features to be added in the future include a scoring mechanism, limited lives, and the ability to earn benefits.
